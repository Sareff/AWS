### Thoughts
First note ever created in this artificial brain. I hope I won't throw away this stuff after a week or so. 

For now, my biggest objective is to create a reliable and smart web of my own knowledge.

### Tasks to achieve this:
- Force yourself to ==take notes== about my and other people's thoughts, knowledge, information;
- Dedicate time to structuring this base, make links, tags and so on;
- Learn anything every day - especially about [[AWS]];
- Try to make my own [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org) about it with **my explanation and understanding** of topics.

I think, that's it for now. More in [[Rules]]
