# Random thoughts

Today I didn't do anything productive, but this Friday (or yesterday if you will) was very productive day. I drove my gf to the dentist and back home. She needed to pull out a wisdom tooth, but she is afraid of dentists, so I supported her and made the company during this scary event of her life. 

After that I've come to the college and meet my teacher. We've talked about psychology and sociology. I've also meet the college director to discuss my contract salary (today i've got money) and the perspective of future work in college. She said that it can be possible only when I will graduate. She also said that I can ignore additional exam for admission to graduation. All this stuff made me happy that day :)

After that my teacher invite me for pizza. We've talked about neuropsychology and how differ women and men actions. One thought flashed inside my mind then - only discussions with people above my age can bring me some enjoyment. My peers can't enjoy me in the main time. At least in my surrounding.
