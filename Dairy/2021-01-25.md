# Sunday is a big day

Today, while I was in the shower, I thought about one fact - tomorrow I should go to the college... But my Zettelkasten are here - on my desktop

Mondays. It's the hardest day of the week. Why? The work week starts from Monday. Why I mention Monday? Tomorrow (or today according to ID) is a Monday. And I've come up with a brilliant idea - I'll use Git & GitHub to store and version my Zettelkasten and work with it from home and from college. 

I am a genius >:)
