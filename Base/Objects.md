# Objects

Objects is a essential entities stored in Amazon S3. Objects consist of meta data and object data, some of this data is opaque to Amazon S3. The metadata is eventually a set of name-value pairs which describe info about object. Thus, according to what I know about metadata and its patterns, it's a place to such things as date of modified, standard HTTP metadata, such as ```Content-Type``` and so on... You can also make a custom metadata if you wish.

An object is uniquely identified with a [[Key]] and a [version ID](<S3 Versioning>).
