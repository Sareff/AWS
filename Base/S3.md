# Simple Storage Service

S3 or Simple Storage Service is a storage for the Internet usage that based in AWS datacenters. 

Amazon S3 allows people to store [objects](Objects) (files) in [buckets](Buckets) (directories). These buckets must have globally unique names, and they are defined at the [region](Regions) level. 

There is a naming convention that every bucket name must follow:
- No uppercase
- No underscore 
- 3-63 characters long
- Not an IP
- Must start with lowercase letter or number

### Advantages of using S3

Amazon S3 (it is its actual name) is created with maximum simplicity and robustness. It is means that S3 has a minimal set of features that provide its basic work with inner entities. Some of advantages of S3:
- Creating Buckets (You can create and name bucket)
- Storing Data ("infinite" amount of data you can store here)
- Downloading Data (Download data from your bucket for anyone who capable of)
- Permissions (Grant access to entities of your bucket to others)
- Standard interfaces (REST and SOAP interfaces to work with any internet-dev kit)

#### Quick Tip

> You can think about Amazon S3 as a basic data map between bundle "bucket + key + version ID" and the object itself
