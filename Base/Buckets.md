# Buckets in S3

A bucket is a container for your [[S3 Objects|objects]] in S3. For example, if you have file (object) with path ```x/y.txt``` that is stored in bucket ```awssamplebucket34``` in the US West (Oregon) Region, then this object is addressable using this URL: ```https://awssamplebucket34.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/x/y.txt```

Buckets serve several purposes inside S3:
- To organize data in Amazon S3 at the highest level - namespaces
- To identify the account which is responsible for data transfer and storage charges
- To access control entities
- To be a unit in reporting aggregation
