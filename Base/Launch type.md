# Launch types  

Launch types allow us to specify how to run our instance. We can rent virtual amount of resources that runs on real hardware with other AWS users resources **or** buy a hardware itself for personal use.

- ==On Demand== Instances: short workload, predictable pricing

- ==Reserved==: (minimum 1 year)

	- Reserved Instances: long workloads

 	- Convertible Reserved Instances: long workloads with flexible instances

	- Scheduled Reserved Instances: workloads only in special Day and special time

- ==Spot== Instances: short workloads, cheap, but less reliable, because you can lose it any time

- ==Dedicated Instances==: no other customers will share your hardware

- ==Dedicated Hosts==: book an entire physical server, control instance placement
