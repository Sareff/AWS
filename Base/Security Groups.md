# Security Groups

Security groups - it is some kind of firewall, that you must assign to your cloud resource (instance, database and so on) to allow traffic from specific port inbound and outbound.  

Security Groups regulate:

- Access to Ports
- Authorized IP ranges â€“ IPv4 and IPv6
- Control of inbound network (from other to the instance)
- Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)

Security Groups are locked down to a [[Regions|region]] / [[VPC]] combination

Example:
