# RDS Multi-AZ

Multi-AZ, or Multi [[Availability Zones|Availability Zone]] - the method of providing RDS users [[High Availability|high availability]] and [[Failover|failover]] support. Multi-AZ deployments for **MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL** DB instances use Amazon's failover technology.

Multi AZ standby RDS DB is always ==**synchronous**==. So, suppose we have same [[DNS]] to receive requests. Over the [[DNS]] we have two DB â€“ first is our **Main DB**, and second is our **Standby DB**. Both of them are in different [[Availability Zones|AZs]]. While first DB is okay, second DB continue synchronize data. If first DB fails, the second start to maintain requests and also become a new Main DB (promoted). 

> Note: The Read Replicas can be setup as Multi AZ for Disaster Recovery (DR).
