# Bucket Policies

A bucket policy is a resource-based AWS [[IAM]] policy. You create a bucket policy to grant access to a bucket to other AWS accounts or [[IAM]] users access permissions for the bucket and objects in it.

A policy contains this basic set of elements:

- Resources - The Amazon S3 resources such as buckets, objects, access points and so on, for which you can grant or deny permissions. Use [[ARN]] to identify resource;
- Actions - For each resource, Amazon S3 support a set of operations. To identify resource operations you need to use keywords;
- Effect - The _allow_ or _deny_ effect to user's request for specific action. If effect isn't written in policy, the final result would be _deny_ as a default.
