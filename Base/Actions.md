# Amazon S3 Actions

Amazon S3 has a set of permissions that we can specify in a [[S3 Bucket Policies|policy]]. These are keywords, each one maps to a specific Amazon S3 operation. For example, we can create bucket with Amazon S3 Action ```s3:CreateBucket```.

Actions in S3 can support one of this [[Resources|resource]] type: 
- Object
- Bucket
- Account
