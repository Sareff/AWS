# Policies and permissions in IAM

When you want to manage your access to AWS services, you use policies that are attached to [[IAM]] identities (users, groups, roles) or AWS resources. A policy by itself is simply an object inside AWS that, when it associated with identity or resource, defines permissions. AWS evaluates policies only when IAM principal (user or role) makes a request. Permissions in policy determine if the request allowed or denied. Most policies are stored in AWS in JSON documents.
